This repository contains the source code for the MELI Order System, a RESTful API developed with Spring Boot. The project was created to address and solve operational issues in an e-commerce order management system, providing a robust, well-documented, and easily testable solution.

**Current Version: 1.0.0** (Core CRUD functionality for orders implemented).

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Full CRUD Functionality:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for orders.
- **In-Memory Database:** Utilizes H2 Database for rapid development and testing, with a web console for easy data inspection.
- **RESTful Architecture:** Follows REST principles for a clean and standard API design.
- **Automated Build & Run:** Includes a startup script (`startup.bat`) to automate the build and execution process, simulating a real-world deployment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Dependencies

- **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.x
- **Language:** Java 17
- **Build Tool:** Apache Maven
- **Core Dependencies:**
  - `Spring Web`: For building RESTful web applications.
  - `Spring Data JPA`: For data persistence and repository management.
  - `H2 Database`: For the in-memory relational database.
- **API Testing:** Postman

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher.
- Apache Maven (can be installed or used via the included Maven Wrapper).
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) for testing the API.

### Installation & Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/carlop13/order_system.git
    cd order_system
    ```

2.  **Run the Startup Script:**
    This is the recommended way to build and run the application. The script automates both steps.
    
    Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows) in the project's root directory and run:
    ```bash
    .\startup.bat
    ```
    The script will first compile and package the application into a `.jar` file using Maven, and then it will launch the server.

3.  **Verify the Application is Running:**
    The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`. You will see the Spring Boot banner and log messages confirming the startup.

## üß™ API Testing with Postman

This repository includes a pre-configured Postman collection to facilitate testing of all CRUD endpoints.

- **File:** `MELI Order System - Sprint 1.postman_collection.json`
- **Location:** Project root directory.

To use it, simply import this file into your Postman application. It contains all the requests (Create, Read, Update, Delete) ready to be executed against your local running server.

## üíª H2 Database Console

While the application is running, you can access the in-memory H2 database console to visually inspect the data.

- **URL:** `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
- **JDBC URL:** `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
- **User Name:** `sa`
- **Password:** (leave blank)

You can run SQL queries like `SELECT * FROM ORDERS;` to see the data you've manipulated via the API.
